== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= How do I allow the plugin access to my Zoho CRM? =
 
Go to `https://accounts.zoho.eu/developerconsole` or `https://accounts.zoho.com/developerconsole` (depending on the region your Zoho CRM is registered in), and add a client ID with the settings shown on the LSX CF Zoho Options page.

= I have added a new field to my Zoho CRM and its not showing up the Caldera Forms processor, how do I resolve this?

In order for this plugin to work at efficient speeds, Zoho CRM fields and users data are cached. If you have added new users or fields to your Zoho CRM, go to the LSX CF Zoho Options page, check the "Flush Cache" checkbox and click the "Save Settings" button. This will flush all cached settings. Next time you edit a processor, new fields and/or users will be displayed.

== Field Formatting ==

* Date fields need to be set in the format yyyy-mm-dd otherwise they will fail.
* The date magic tag can be used in the following format "{date:Y-m-d}"

== Processor Configuration ==

* When setting a "Layout" you will need to include the name and the ID separated by a | symbol.  The name goes first, and then the ID. e.g "Direct|11111111111"
